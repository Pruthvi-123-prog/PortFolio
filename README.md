### 📧 Email Configuration (Contact Form)

> **🔐 SECURITY NOTE**: Never use your regular email password! See `SECURITY_ALTERNATIVES.md` for secure options.

The contact form uses server-side email sending with OTP verification. To enable this feature:

1. **Gmail App Password (Recommended)**:
   - Enable 2-Factor Authentication on Gmail
   - Generate an App Password: Google Account → Security → App passwords
   - Use the 16-character app password in your `.env.local`

2. **Add environment variables** to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
   ```

3. **Alternative Options**: 
   - **EmailJS**: Client-side email service (no server credentials needed)
   - **Netlify Forms**: If deploying to Netlify
   - **Formspree**: External form handling service
   
   See `SECURITY_ALTERNATIVES.md` for detailed setup instructions.

4. **Alternative Email Services**:

**Note**: Never commit `.env.local` to version control. The file is already in `.gitignore`.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
